Dear Hiring Manager,\\
\vspace{2mm}

I am Venkaiah Kavuri, postdoctoral researcher from Dr. Arjun Yodh\textquotesingle s lab in Department of Physics at University of Pennsylvania. I am writing in to express my interest in \textbf{Engineer/Scientist} position at your company. As a forward thinking postdoc, I am motivated to be part of several projects simultaneously by involving in different roles such as development, data processing/programing and testing. Areas of strength that will guide me in delivering successes towards meeting your organization's goals include  \textbf{Instrument Development, Signal Processing, Image reconstruction, Algorithm Development, and Statistical Analysis.}\\
\vspace{2mm} 


Some of my technical proficiencies include:\\
\begin{itemize}\itemsep -2pt
\item Designing, conducting and testing of optical device prototypes and develop commercially-viable product enhancements.\\
\item Demonstrated record in optical modeling using problem-solving techniques such as Numerical modeling, Imaging-Inverse problems, Imaging-Optimization and Data mining.\\

\end{itemize} 

While working as a Postdoc at University of Pennsylvania; I originated, designed and built an optical flow measurement device to be used in Neural ICU for predicting recurrent stroke. I am also working on wearable blood flow measurement device(using Intel Edison) to be used for measuring blood flow in muscle. During my Phd at University of Texas Arlington, I applied statistical methods to develop a new technique for detecting and imaging early stages of aggressive prostate cancer by creating, engineering and building a TRUS-compatible DOT Probe. I also originated, designed and built multi-spectral, low-cost and portable DOT instrumentation then improved existing image reconstruction methods by combining depth compensation algorithm and L1-regularized least squares method.\\

\vspace{2mm} 
I welcome the opportunity to participate in a personal interview to answer your questions and better present my qualifications. I look forward to speaking with you soon.\\
\vspace{2mm} 
Thank you for your time and consideration.\\
\vspace{10mm} 
Sincerely,\\

\vspace{5mm} 
Venkaiah Kavuri\\
